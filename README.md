## 👋 Wenderson — Senior Full Stack Developer

I design and build **production-grade systems** with a strong focus on **architecture, maintainability and scalability**.

My experience spans web and mobile front-ends with React and React Native, and back-end systems built with NestJS, Ruby on Rails, Python and Java, usually backed by PostgreSQL.

I’m especially interested in solving problems involving **offline-first systems, data consistency and real-time communication**.
